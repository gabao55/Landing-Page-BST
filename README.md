<h1 align="center">Landing-Page-BST</h1>

This repository consists on a landing page I developed as a front-end project. It is a first contact project with HTML and CSS and it comes to explaining a little about a very used data structure called Binary Search Tree (BST), showing some methods involved by the structure, giving examples and showing some code developed in C language for it by me.

It will be deployed by netlify, so if you want to check the site, you can access it by clicking <a href='https://bstlandingpage.netlify.app/' target='_blank'>here</a>.
